    Possible bug in `canvasapi` module…
    When calling `get_users` with the argument `include='test_student'`, the
    module adds it to the URL as `include=test_studentanalytics_url`.  The
    origin of the "analytics_url" string is unknown.  However, it's known that
    the Canvas API expects the "include" argument to appear as `include[]`, so
    by using a dictionary here with the key in the correct format, the bug is
    bypassed and the argument appears correctly.
    Strangely, a later call to `get_rubric` uses the `include` keyword argument
    without problem.
